# Intuition
---
- The problem requires finding an element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times in the array.  
- Since the majority element must appear `more than half the time`, even if we start `canceling` it out `with` other `different elements`, it will still remain in the end.  
- This leads to the intuition that we can use a **`voting-based approach`**.
- Where we
  - increase a count when we see the same element
  - decrease it when we see a different one.
---

# Approach
We use the **`Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm`**, which works in two phases:

1. **Candidate Selection**:  
   - Initialize `count = 0` and `candidate = 0`.
   - Iterate over the array:
     - If `count == 0`, set `candidate = num`.
     - If `num == candidate`, increment `count`.
     - Else, decrement `count`.
   - The final `candidate` is a potential majority element.

2. **Validation (optional)**: `(only if majority isn't guaranteed).`  
   - Reset `count = 0`, and iterate over the array again to count the frequency of `candidate`.
   - If its count is more than `n / 2`, return it.  
   - Otherwise, return that no majority element exists 

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)** — One pass to find the candidate, one pass to validate (if needed)

### Space Complexity
- **O(1)** — No extra space used

### Array = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]

| Step | num | candidate | count | Explanation                    |
|------|-----|-----------|-------|--------------------------------|
| 1    | 2   | 2         | 1     | count = 0 → set candidate = 2  |
| 2    | 2   | 2         | 2     | same as candidate → count++    |
| 3    | 1   | 2         | 1     | different → count--            |
| 4    | 1   | 2         | 0     | different → count--            |
| 5    | 1   | 1         | 1     | count = 0 → new candidate = 1  |
| 6    | 2   | 1         | 0     | different → count--            |
| 7    | 2   | 2         | 1     | count = 0 → new candidate = 2  |

## Code : 
### Phase-1 :
- Find the Candidate
```cpp
for(int num : nums)
    {
        if(count == 0)
        {
            candidate = num;
        }
        if(num == candidate)
        {
            count++;
        }
        else if(num != candidate)
        {
            count--;
        }

    }
```
- Varify the candidate - is the candidate is the majority element or not :
  - Count the frequency of the candidate
  - If `count` > `size/2`
    - return `candidate`
  - else
    - return `no majority element`
```cpp

    //validate
    count = 0;
    for(int num : nums)
    {
        if(candidate == num)
        {
            count++; // count the frequency of the candidate
        }
    }

    if(count > nums.size()/2)
    {
        cout<<candidate;
    }
    else{
        cout<<"No majority element exist";
    }
```
