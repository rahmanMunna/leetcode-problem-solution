# Intuition
The problem requires finding an element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times in the array.  
Since the majority element must appear more than half the time, even if we start canceling it out with other different elements, it will still remain in the end.  
This leads to the intuition that we can use a *voting-based approach*, where we increase a count when we see the same element and decrease it when we see a different one.

---

# Approach
We use the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**, which works in two phases:

1. **Candidate Selection**:  
   - Initialize `count = 0` and `candidate = 0`.
   - Iterate over the array:
     - If `count == 0`, set `candidate = num`.
     - If `num == candidate`, increment `count`.
     - Else, decrement `count`.
   - The final `candidate` is a potential majority element.

2. **Validation (optional)**:  
   - Reset `count = 0`, and iterate through the array again to count the frequency of `candidate`.
   - If its count is more than `n / 2`, return it.  
   - Otherwise, return that no majority element exists (only if majority isn't guaranteed).

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)** — One pass to find the candidate, one pass to validate (if needed)

### Space Complexity
- **O(1)** — No extra space used

### Array = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]

| Step | num | candidate | count | Explanation                    |
|------|-----|-----------|-------|--------------------------------|
| 1    | 2   | 2         | 1     | count = 0 → set candidate = 2  |
| 2    | 2   | 2         | 2     | same as candidate → count++    |
| 3    | 1   | 2         | 1     | different → count--            |
| 4    | 1   | 2         | 0     | different → count--            |
| 5    | 1   | 1         | 1     | count = 0 → new candidate = 1  |
| 6    | 2   | 1         | 0     | different → count--            |
| 7    | 2   | 2         | 1     | count = 0 → new candidate = 2  |

## Code : 
### Phase-1 :
- Find the Candidate
```cpp
for(int num : nums)
    {
        if(count == 0)
        {
            candidate = num;
        }
        if(num == candidate)
        {
            count++;
        }
        else if(num != candidate)
        {
            count--;
        }

    }
```
- Varify the candidate - if majority element not exist :
```cpp

    //validate
    count = 0;
    for(int num : nums)
    {
        if(candidate == num)
        {
            count++;
        }
    }

    if(count > nums.size()/2)
    {
        cout<<candidate;
    }
    else{
        cout<<"No majority element exist";
    }
```
